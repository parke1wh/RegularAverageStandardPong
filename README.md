*UNITY REQUIRED*
To download and setup:
1. Download the github zip file and extract to a folder of your choosing.
2. Download unity and install, a free account may be required. 
3. Once installed you may need to setup a free license with unity. (Unity's licensing agreements still apply)
	a. Go to preferences (Gear icon as of 2/29/24)
	b. Go to licenses
	c. Click Add
	d. Click get a free personal license 
4. Once you are done you can close the windows until you are back to the "projects" screen.
5. Click "Add" in the top right and navigate to where you have extracted the github files
6. Click open in that folder. If it states the project is not valid you might be in the wrong folder when opening
7. Once added it should list an editor version. You will likely need to download that editor version when prompted as newer version can break non-updated code and thus break the game.

To play:

Use Keyboard Arrows

1. Once the project is added and the correct editor is downloaded you can launch the game by clicking on it in the projects list
2. This should initialize the game but will not have the "scene" required.
3. In the bottom left you should have a "Projects" folder that is open. Inside this folder will be an "Assets" folder. Click on assets if it is not already opened (otherwise it will close).
4. Inside this folder is a "Scenes" folder click on that, again if it isn't already open
5. Double click the scene labeled "StartScreenScene.unity"
6. The scene should populate in the top left "Hierarchy" 
7. Click on Maximize scene on play for better visibility. Otherwise click the play icon in the top middle


Note: You can select 1 or 2 players. Use keyboard arrows for player 1 and W & S keys for player 2. 1 player will play with AI.

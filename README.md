To download and setup:
1. Download the github zip file and extract to a folder of your choosing.
2. Download unity and install, a free account may be required. 
3. Once installed you may need to setup a free license with unity. (Unity's licensing agreements still apply)
	a. Go to preferences (Gear icon as of 2/29/24)
	b. Go to licenses
	c. Click Add
	d. Click get a free personal license 
4. Once you are done you can close the windows until you are back to the "projects" screen.
5. Click "Add" in the top right and navigate to where you have extracted the github files
6. Click open in that folder. If it states the project is not valid you might be in the wrong folder when opening
7. Once added it should list an editor version. You will likely need to download that editor version when prompted as newer version can break non-updated code and thus break the game.
